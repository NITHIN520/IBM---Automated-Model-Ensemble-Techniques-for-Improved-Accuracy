Phase 4: Model Deployment and Interface Development

4.1 Overview of Model Deployment and Interface Development

Phase 4 focuses on deploying the trained ensemble model using Flask for both the API and the web interface. The goal is to make the ensemble model accessible in a production environment by exposing it via a Flask-based API and creating a user-friendly web interface. This phase ensures that stakeholders can interact with the model, make predictions, and analyze results efficiently.

4.2 Deploying the Model

To deploy the trained ensemble model, we utilize Flask and a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. The deployment process includes the following steps:

Model Export: The trained ensemble model (e.g., bagging, boosting, or stacking) is saved using the pickle module.

import pickle

# Save the trained ensemble model
with open("ensemble_model.pkl", "wb") as model_file:
    pickle.dump(ensemble_model, model_file)

Creating an API with Flask: The API will accept input data, perform predictions using the ensemble model, and return the results.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained ensemble model
with open("ensemble_model.pkl", "rb") as model_file:
    model = pickle.load(model_file)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    input_data = np.array(data['input']).reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Deploying Flask on Cloud: The API can be deployed using cloud services like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, or Azure App Service.

4.3 Developing the Web Interface Using Flask

Instead of using Streamlit or React, we will build a Flask-based web interface to interact with the model.

Flask Web Interface

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import pickle
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained ensemble model
with open("ensemble_model.pkl", "rb") as model_file:
    model = pickle.load(model_file)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    features = [float(x) for x in request.form.values()]
    input_data = np.array([features])
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    return render_template('index.html', prediction_text=f'Predicted Output: {prediction[0]}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

HTML Interface (templates/index.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Ensemble Model Prediction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Ensemble Model Prediction</h2>
    <form action="/predict" method="post">
        <label>Feature 1:</label>
        <input type="text" name="feature1"><br>
        <label>Feature 2:</label>
        <input type="text" name="feature2"><br>
        <label>Feature 3:</label>
        <input type="text" name="feature3"><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Predict">
    </form>
    {% if prediction_text %}
        <h3>{{ prediction_text }}</h3>
    {% endif %}
</body>
</html>

4.4 Cloud Platform Considerations

Scalability: Deploy using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Azure App Service for automatic scaling.

Security: Use HTTPS, API keys, or authentication to secure API access.

Monitoring: Enable logging and monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch or Google Operations.

Cost Optimization: Use serverless deployment options to reduce costs.

4.5 Conclusion of Phase 4

In this phase, we successfully deployed the automated ensemble model using Flask for both API and web interface. The deployment ensures real-time accessibility of predictions, and the web interface enables seamless interaction with the model. By leveraging Flask and cloud computing, the model is now production-ready and optimized for real-world applications.
